# Photos Directory

This directory stores photos that appear in tooltips when hovering over or tapping specific words in the About section.

## Naming Convention

- Use lowercase letters
- Use hyphens to separate words
- Use `.jpg` or `.png` file extension
- Examples:
  - `noe.jpg` (for the word "Noe")
  - `brooklyn.jpg` (for "Brooklyn")
  - `san-gabriel-valley.jpg` (for "San Gabriel Valley")

## Usage

Photos are referenced in the `WordWithPhoto` component using paths like:
- `/photos/noe.jpg`
- `/photos/brooklyn.jpg`

The path should start with `/photos/` and match the filename in this directory.
